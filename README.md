# Sterling E-Commerce Sales Analysis

### Project Overview

This data analysis project aims to provide insights into the sales performance of an e-commerce company over the past year. By analyzing various aspects of the sales data, we seek to identify trends, make data-driven recommendations, and gain a deeper understanding of the company's performance.

- Tableau - Data analysis and creating reports

### Data Cleaning/Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Handling missing values.
3. Data cleaning and formatting

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions, such as:

- Customer Base:
  - Gender Breakdown: How are our customers distributed across genders? Is there a dominant demographic?
  - Revenue Generation: What is the total revenue generated in the last years?
   
- Product Performance:
  - Top Sellers: Which products are ordered the most? Are there any unexpected best-sellers?
  - Revenue Stars: Which products generate the highest overall revenue? Do these align with the top sellers?
  - Category Focus: How are orders and revenue distributed across different product categories? Are there any under-performing or over-performing categories?

- Payment Trends:
  - Preferred Payment Methods: Which payment methods do customers use most frequently? Is there a preferred method?
  - Revenue by Payment Method: Which payment methods generate the highest revenue? Is there a disconnect between popularity and revenue?

- Revenue Trends:
  - Revenue Growth: How has our overall revenue evolved? Are there any seasonal patterns or significant fluctuations?
  - Local Presence: Which counties are the top 10 contributors to revenue and order quantity? Are there any emerging markets of interest?
 
### Data Analysis


### Key Results/Findings
1. Gender distribution is almost equal: There's a near-even split between male and female customers (52% male, 48% female), aligning with the targeted market.

2. Mobiles & Tablets dominate sales and revenue: This category accounts for the most orders (29%) and the highest overall revenue (56%). Sterling should consider investigating profit margins for this category compared to others.

3. Cash on Delivery (COD) is the most popular, but Bankalfalah generates the most revenue: There's a disconnect between transaction volume and revenue. COD is the most used payment method (36% of orders) but contributes only 14% to revenue, whereas Bankalfalah (8% of orders) generates 20% of income. Further investigation is needed to understand this.

4. Revenue fluctuates with seasonal trends: There's significant fluctuation in revenue between months. Revenue surges from February to April (over 800% increase) and a substantive increase in December (500% increase), likely due to seasonal festivities. There's a drop in revenue in May.

5. Los Angeles is the top revenue generator, but other counties require attention: Los Angeles generates the highest revenue, indicating customer satisfaction. While Monroe and Jefferson also contribute significantly, counties like Winston, Polk, and Washington require targeted strategies to improve revenue.

### RecommendationS

- Optimize product offerings based on performance and profitability: Prioritize categories like Mobiles & Tablets with high revenue despite lower order volume, while analyzing pricing and potential margin improvements for underperforming categories like School & Education/Books.

- Improve user experience and marketing for underutilized payment methods: Investigate user experience or technical issues hindering Cashatdoorstep and financesettlement usage, alongside targeted marketing campaigns to promote their benefits.

- Develop targeted strategies for emerging markets: Implement specific marketing and promotional campaigns focusing on counties like Winston, Polk, and Washington to capitalize on their revenue potential.

- Leverage seasonality trends for strategic promotions: Plan marketing and promotional activities around periods of peak revenue like December festivities and February-April surge to maximize sales.

- Explore advanced data analysis techniques: Utilize predictive analytics and customer segmentation to personalize offerings, predict future behavior, and identify potential churn risk for targeted retention strategies.

By implementing these recommendations based on our data-driven insights, Sterling E-Commerce can optimize its product offerings, streamline operations, and enhance customer experience for continued growth and success.
